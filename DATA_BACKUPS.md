# Data Backup and Restoration Protocol

This document outlines the procedures for backing up and restoring data for the Kurt Storey Foundation platform.

## Backup Schedule

| Data Type | Frequency | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| PostgreSQL Database | Daily | 30 days | Secure cloud storage |
| Application Logs | Weekly | 90 days | Secure cloud storage |
| Audit Logs | Daily | 1 year | Secure cloud storage |
| Configuration Files | On change | 5 versions | Version control |

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backups

Daily automated backups are performed using the following process:

1. Full database dump using pg_dump
2. Compression and encryption of the backup file
3. Transfer to secure cloud storage
4. Verification of backup integrity
5. Rotation of old backups according to retention policy

Example backup command:
```bash
pg_dump -U postgres -d kurt_foundation_db | gzip > /backups/kurt_foundation_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
```

### Log Backups

Application and audit logs are backed up using the following process:

1. Collection of logs from all application instances
2. Compression and encryption of log files
3. Transfer to secure cloud storage
4. Verification of backup integrity
5. Rotation of old backups according to retention policy

## Restoration Procedures

### Database Restoration

To restore the database from a backup:

1. Identify the appropriate backup file
2. Decrypt and decompress the backup file
3. Restore the database using pg_restore
4. Verify data integrity
5. Document the restoration in POSTMORTEMS.md

Example restoration command:
```bash
gunzip -c /backups/kurt_foundation_20250409.sql.gz | psql -U postgres -d kurt_foundation_db
```

### Log Restoration

To restore logs from backup:

1. Identify the appropriate log backup
2. Decrypt and decompress the backup file
3. Place logs in the appropriate directory
4. Verify log integrity
5. Document the restoration in POSTMORTEMS.md

## Testing Schedule

To ensure the reliability of our backup and restoration procedures:

| Test Type | Frequency | Responsible Party |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Database Restoration | Monthly | Database Administrator |
| Log Restoration | Quarterly | System Administrator |
| Full Disaster Recovery | Bi-annually | Operations Team |

## Backup Monitoring

All backup processes are monitored for:
- Successful completion
- Backup size anomalies
- Storage capacity issues
- Transfer errors

Alerts are sent to the operations team in case of any issues with the backup process.

## Documentation

Each backup and restoration operation must be documented with:
- Date and time
- Type of operation
- Files involved
- Result of the operation
- Any issues encountered
- Resolution of issues
