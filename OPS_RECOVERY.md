# Operations Recovery Procedures

This document outlines the procedures to follow in case of operational issues with the Kurt Storey Foundation platform.

## Database Recovery

### Snapshot Restoration
1. Access the database backup system
2. Identify the most recent valid snapshot
3. Follow the restoration procedure:
   ```
   # Example restoration command
   pg_restore -d kurt_foundation_db backup_file.dump
   ```
4. Verify data integrity after restoration
5. Log the recovery in POSTMORTEMS.md

### Partial Data Recovery
For cases where only specific data needs to be recovered:
1. Identify the affected data
2. Use point-in-time recovery if available
3. Manually verify and correct data if necessary
4. Document the process in POSTMORTEMS.md

## Application Outages

### Frontend Issues
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify build process completed successfully
3. If necessary, roll back to the last known good deployment
4. Document the issue and resolution

### Backend Issues
1. Check API endpoint health
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check for resource constraints (memory, CPU)
4. Restart services if necessary
5. Document the issue and resolution

## Email System Recovery

If the email system fails:
1. Check Resend service status
2. Verify API keys and authentication
3. Check for rate limiting issues
4. Use the admin dashboard to manually retry failed emails
5. If necessary, implement the status page fallback for critical communications

## Emergency Contacts

In case of critical issues that require immediate attention:

**Primary Contact**: [Primary Contact Name]
- Email: primary@kurtfoundation.org
- Phone: [Phone Number]

**Secondary Contact**: [Secondary Contact Name]

- Phone: [Phone Number]

## Governance Freeze Recovery

If a `.gov_freeze` is in place and preventing necessary operations:
1. Convene an emergency meeting of available stewards
2. Document the need for lifting the freeze
3. Create a PR to remove the freeze with appropriate approvals
4. Document the process in OVERRIDES.md

## Regular Testing

These recovery procedures should be tested regularly:
- Database restoration: Monthly
- Email retry functionality: Bi-weekly
- Application rollback: Quarterly
