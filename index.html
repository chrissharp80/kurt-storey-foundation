        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe every child deserves the chance to discover their voice through music.
          The Play It Forward Foundation exists to provide instruments, mentorship, and support
          to young people who can’t access them otherwise — because music opens doors, builds
          confidence, and connects hearts.
        </p>

          This work is inspired by the quiet legacy of <strong>Kurt Storey</strong> — a sound engineer, friend, and mentor
          who spent his life helping others shine. He never asked for attention, but gave everything
          he had to those around him. In his spirit, we carry this mission forward — with empathy,
          humility, and joy.

        and made the room better without needing credit. Who doesn’t fall in love with that?”
