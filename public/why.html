    <h2>Why Kurt?</h2>
    
    <p>This foundation — and this platform — exists because Kurt Storey lived music as a way of giving. He didn't care about status. He cared about getting instruments to kids who couldn't afford them. He didn't wait for permission. He acted — with heart, with hustle, and with humility.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      "Kurt never talked about access. He just handed someone a guitar and said, 'Play.'"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>The platform reflects that ethos. It's not just a website. It's a tool to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Receive help requests with dignity</li>
      <li>Get instruments to kids quickly</li>
      <li>Make sure no one gets forgotten</li>
      <li>Track every decision without red tape</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This page — /why — reminds us why the rest exists.</p>
    
    <h3>Kurt's Story</h3>
    
    <p>Kurt Storey was a musician, mentor, and community builder who believed that music could change lives. Throughout his life, he collected instruments and connected them with young people who showed interest but lacked resources.</p>
    
    <p>His approach was simple but profound: remove barriers, provide opportunities, and let the music do the rest. Kurt never sought recognition for his generosity — he simply wanted to share the joy of music with others.</p>
